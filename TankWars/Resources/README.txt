Desgin Decisions:

For our Tank Wars project we first started with trying to implement everything just as the provided client shows. Once we started getting pretty close to the same functionality as the
provided client we started to veer off and add some of our own designs. First off we created our own tank and turret images as well as our own background and title screen. We did this 
just because we had finished the bulk of the project early and wanted to make it our own instead of using the provided images. We also added to our View the ability to display your HP, player name, and score.
Besides the View we implemented some of our own functionalities. We noticed that the provided client did 2 things differently than our client. First is that when you die the camera does not move, 
but rather it stays over where you died until you spawn again then the camera moves. We also noticed that the tanks movements are always smooth, and it does not ever stop when pressing multiple buttons at once.
We added both of these functionalities to our Tank Wars client.
